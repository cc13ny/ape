\section{Results}

We were able to easily write and schedule the following programs: 

\subsection{Simple}
x = T.matrix('x')
y = x*x
z = y.sum()

\subsection{Block Matrix Multiply}

\subsection{Shallow water or Burger's equation}

\subsubsection{Show off with simultaneous computation of derivatives?}
