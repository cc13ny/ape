\section{Arrays}

\subsection{Describing Computation}

Array operations form a convenient syntax for human users to communicate scientific programs and computational kernels. 

\subsection{Predictability}

Array operations are also a convenient set of operations to give to
computers. They are highly optimized and very predictable. 

In order to statically schedule a computation we need to know the runtimes and
communication times beforehand. This is hard in general but we pose that it is
feasible with array operations. How reasonable of an assumption is this?
