\section{Background}

\subsection{Automatic distribution of a large program to many machines}
There are many projects attempting to solve the same issue. They're taking
different approaches. 

\subsection{Arrays as primitives}
There are also a few projects that treat arrays as primitives. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item MatLab
\item Theano : computation as graph of array operations
\item PETSc and others : Distributed arrays operations
\item FLAME
\item PLAPACK : very similar project - lower level - assumes regular
architecture/homogeneity - doesn't profile
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{DAG Task Scheduling on Heterogeneous Machines}
NP-Complete problem. Some heuristics exist. List scheduling.
